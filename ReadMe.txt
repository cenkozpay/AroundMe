AroundMe is a Techcrunch Hackathon project.

There are many web sites and applications on the Internet, that gives data about places of interest and some of them are 
location aware. But most of the these are not direction aware. Our web application (based on HTML5) will get your current 
location through GPS on your smart phone, calculate the cultural or historical places near by and will give you photos 
and small information about these places. When you turn your smart phone, the data changes according to the direction. So 
you can get information about a place where you are looking into. 

The location data is obtained from Google maps API and the data and pictures of the places is obtained from Wikipedia.

The web site is on http://aroundme.azurewebsites.net
